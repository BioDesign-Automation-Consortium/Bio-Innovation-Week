        ## Hotels
        Hotels close to Boston University and Asimov during Bio-Design Week may be more expensive than usual due to a Red Sox-Yankees series happening during the same week. We recommend looking at hotels along the MBTAâ€™s Green Line (B) or within a reasonable walking distance to Boston University. There are options over in the Longwood Medical area (~25 minute walk or ~15 min by public transportation). Hotels in Cambridge may also be less expensive, but would require a longer commute.
