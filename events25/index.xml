This year, IWBDA will take place during &lt;a href="https://biodesign-automation-consortium.github.io/Bio-Innovation-Week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bio Innovation Week&lt;/a> and will include presentation and poster talks selected from submitted abstracts, Birds of a Feather discussions, and breakout sessions on selected topics. We aim to bring together academic researchers and industry partners to push the field of bio-design automation for synthetic biology forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The field of biology is still lagging behind the industry when it comes to implementation and adoption of computational and digital solutions. This is primarily because it is extremely difficult to offer a one-size-fits-all solution to engineer biology. Some BDA solutions serve as templates for a larger problem, but, to make it usable in a practical setting, the solutions often have to be redesigned for bespoke biological workflows. Without understanding the requirements of the broader synthetic biology community, it is hard to design a solution that can have a wider impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Increasing the efficiency of biological processes and workflows with biodesign automation is a continuous journey that requires fresh exchange of ideas. It is crucial for the BDA community to have a forum where they can collaborate, gather new perspectives, and understand the requirements of the broader synthetic biology community. IWBDA provides this forum for cross-disciplinary discussion, with the aim of seeding and fostering collaboration between the researchers from the synthetic biology, systems biology, and design automation communities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NonaWorks 2025</title><link>/events25/nonaworks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/events25/nonaworks/</guid><description>&lt;p>Get ready for an exciting hackathon event as part of &lt;a href="https://biodesign-automation-consortium.github.io/Bio-Innovation-Week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bio Innovation Week&lt;/a>! This event is designed to bring together a diverse group of individuals passionate about innovation and problem-solving in the field of bio software development. You&amp;rsquo;ll have the opportunity to meet researchers working on cutting-edge algorithms, industry professionals in the biotechnology space, and other like-minded participants. Throughout the hackathon, expert office hours will provide valuable guidance, and workshops will equip you with essential skills for developing bio software. Volunteers will be available to offer support as you engage in project development. This event will culminate in a Demo Day where you can showcase your innovative projects to an eager audience. Don&amp;rsquo;t miss this chance to collaborate, network, and make a lasting impact at the hackathon during Biodesign Week!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
